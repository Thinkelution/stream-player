  caveats <<~EOS
    OpenStreamPlayer is ad-hoc signed and is not notarized by Apple.
    If macOS blocks launch, try System Settings > Privacy & Security > Open Anyway.
    If that option is absent, users who trust this release may explicitly approve
    this app after verifying its signature:
      codesign --verify --deep --strict /Applications/OpenStreamPlayer.app &&
        xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/OpenStreamPlayer.app
    This skips Gatekeeper's first-launch check for this app only.
    Launch OpenStreamPlayer, then configure your playlist in Settings.
